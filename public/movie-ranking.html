<h3>Spiderman</h3>
<p>"with great power comes with great responsibility"</p>
<p>Spider-Man is a beloved superhero for many reasons. One of the most prominent reasons is that he is an everyman hero. He is a regular person gifted with extraordinary power and forced to accept the responsibility that comes with it through personal tragedy. His suffering creates a deeper sense of empathy for others, and he uses his powers to prevent strangers from having to endure the pain he has to live with forever.
<br />
Additionally, Spider-Man is a relatable character. He is a young guy whose silliness and awkwardness make him one of the most relatable superheroes to exist. He is also a hero who is not afraid to show his emotions and vulnerabilities, which makes him more human and endearing.
<br />
Finally, Spider-Man is a symbol of hope and resilience. He is a hero who never gives up, no matter how difficult the situation may be. He inspires people to be their best selves and to never lose hope, even in the darkest of times.</p>
